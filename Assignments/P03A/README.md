## P03A - RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock
### Kolten Pulliam
### Description:

This program creates a two players that play a variant of 
RockPaperScissors. This accomplished by assigning random
"hands" to each player, which are really just unicode values
stored as strings. The players are then checked against each other
by seeing whose hand is greater than the other which is all done 
by overloading the greater than operator. 
(The first 5 classes, the two maps, and the unicode assignments 
where all done by Professor Terry Griffin)
